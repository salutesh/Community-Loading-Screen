## Troubleshoot

### How do I make a edds file ?
Near the end of this page you should have a quick tutorial: https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/%5BModding%5D-Adding-custom-loading-screen

### The screen is white !
The path of your pictures is incorrect or the naming is wrong. The mod was not able to find the picture(s).

It could also be because your DayZ Tools "Addon Builder" doesn't include json files.

### I have compiled my mod but I don't see anything new, it's like if my mod was not there.
The path to your scripts is incorrect or it failed to compile the pbo containing the scripts.
